## Console into your router

To do this, first ssh to the Base Pod VM (assuming podx):

```
AKSHSHAR-M-33WP:~ akshshar$ ssh -i ~/nanog75.key tesuto@hackathon.podx.cloud.tesuto.com
Last login: Sun Feb 17 03:04:40 2019 from 172.17.0.1
== Tesuto Jumpbox ==
Type '?' or 'help' to get the list of commands
Running Hosts:

host: rtr1
  ip: 100.96.0.14
host: rtr2
  ip: 100.96.0.16
host: rtr3
  ip: 100.96.0.18
host: ztp
  ip: 100.96.0.20
host: dev1
  ip: 100.96.0.22

  ip: 100.96.0.24
host: rtr4
  ip: 100.96.0.26
tesuto@jumpbox:~$ 
tesuto@jumpbox:~$ 

```

As the above output indicates, on the Base pod VM you can press `?` to see the list of commands available to you.

To console into router rtr2, simply type:  `console rtr2` on the base Pod VM:

>For your convenience, we have set up a backdoor user on the router with credentials:  
>
>**Username**: rtrdev
>**Password**: nanog75sf  
>
>On an actual router, this user is not present, this is only been made available for this hackathon to make things simpler.

## Testing your ZTP script

You don't need to actually perform ZTP to test your ZTP script. 
To accomplish this, first ssh into your ZTP box:  

```
AKSHSHAR-M-33WP:~ akshshar$ ssh -i ~/nanog75.key tesuto@ztp.hackathon.pod0.cloud.tesuto.com
Warning: the ECDSA host key for 'ztp.hackathon.pod0.cloud.tesuto.com' differs from the key for the IP address '35.197.94.94'
Offending key for IP in /Users/akshshar/.ssh/known_hosts:1
Matching host key in /Users/akshshar/.ssh/known_hosts:5

tesuto@ztp:~$ 
tesuto@ztp:~$ 
tesuto@ztp:~$ 
tesuto@ztp:~$ 

```

Start editing the script in the location: `/var/www/html/scripts/ztp_ncclient.py`
(you will need to become sudo).


```
tesuto@ztp:~$ sudo vi /var/www/html/scripts/ztp_ncclient.py
```

Once changed, then console into the router as explained earlier above and drop into the router bash shell:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#bash
Sun Feb 17 09:42:58.139 UTC


[host:~]$ 
[host:~]$ 
```

Now download the ZTP script you just edited/modified into the router bash, make it executable and run it:


```
[host:~]$ wget http://100.96.0.20/scripts/ztp_ncclient.py
--2019-02-17 09:43:19--  http://100.96.0.20/scripts/ztp_ncclient.py

[host:~]$ 
[host:~]$ 
[host:~]$ chmod +x ztp_ncclient.py 
[host:~]$ 
[host:~]$ 
[host:~]$ ./ztp_ncclient.py 



```

This becomes a quick way to test your ZTP script and the router bash shell allows you to use all typical python interpreter capabilities to ease the process.


## Testing the ZTP process

Ok, so you've created a ZTP script that works, now what?

Well, time to test the ZTP workflow:

We have already seen that the DHCP server is set up to respond with the location of the script `ztp_ncclient.py` to router `rtr2` when it sends the appropriate ZTP request. 

There are two ways to perform ZTP on any router in the current topology:

### Manually from console while the router is up


To initiate ZTP on router rtr2 while it is still up, first connect to the console of router `rtr2`.   



Now to initiate ZTP manually, we basically need to execute the CLI `ztp initiate noprompt` in the router CLI shell.
However, since this setup reserves a single IP address from the DHCP server for each router, executing ZTP manually from an already provisioned box (rtr2) will fail since the ISC-DHCP server will not reissue an IP to the router that already has the IP present.

To make it simple, we have a created a small script to remove the ip from the Managment port and execute `ztp initiate noprompt` for us. 

So, in order to perform manual ZTP on any of the routers in the topology, simply run the following commands in router console:

### Initiating a wipe and reset (Repair)

**Note**:  You only need to do this to showcase a true ZTP workflow once you've already tested the ZTP script and the manual ZTP workflow as described above. Repair takes a long time (10+ minutes). Use the manual ZTP trigger process shown above to initiate the ZTP process while coding the script.
{: .notice--warning} 


To perform a repair on the node, we need to use Tesuto UI.

For this purpose login to the Tesuto UI at :   

><https://cloud.tesuto.com>  

with the following credentials:

**Username**:  &lt;Your email id&gt;
**Password**:  &lt;password provided via email&gt;
{: .notice--info}



![tesuto_repair_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tesuto_repair_1.png)


Now click on your assigned pod number (`podx`) and it will open up the devices page for you. Hover to the button on right of the name `rtr2`, click and select `repair`.


![tesuto_repair2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tesuto_repair2.png)


You will get a prompt, select `yes` and this will wipe out the rtr2 disk and boot from scratch.
This process is equivalent to provisioning a fresh router without config in your network.

### Logs During Execution.

When ZTP is executing (whether manual or through repair), to view the ongoing logs, console into the router, drop into `bash` and do a `tail -f` on `/var/log/ztp.log`
