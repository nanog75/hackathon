## Before we Begin

Make sure you have access to a Pod based on the pod number assigned to you.
The instructions to connect to your pod can be found here: 

>[Connect to your pod]({{ base_path }}/connect-to-pods/)



## Connect to the ZTP box


For the Day0 group, all of the operations will be performed on the ZTP box.

Based on the pod number (assuming `x`), connect to your ZTP box first:


```
AKSHSHAR-M-33WP:~ akshshar$ ssh -i ~/nanog75.key tesuto@ztp.hackathon.podx.cloud.tesuto.com
Warning: the ECDSA host key for 'ztp.hackathon.podx.cloud.tesuto.com' differs from the key for the IP address '35.197.94.94'
Offending key for IP in /Users/akshshar/.ssh/known_hosts:1
Matching host key in /Users/akshshar/.ssh/known_hosts:5
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

## The Goal

The goal of the Day0 group is to make all the routers perform ZTP to attain a base configuration required for subsequent operations.


**Important**: ZTP is an impactful operation and can affect other users in the topology. Therefore, to start off, only `rtr2` has been earmarked for exclusive use by the Day0 group.
**DO NOT** perform ZTP on the other routers in your topology until you have a working ZTP script.
{: .notice--danger}

## The Basics

### What is ZTP?

ZTP stands for Zero touch provisioning and involves bringing up a router from scratch (without any configuration) by providing a ZTP script or a CLI configuration file to the router as part of the  DHCP offer in response to the router's request.
This process is shown below:

![ztp_workflow.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ztp_workflow.png)


1. When the router receives a CLI configuration file, it will replace its existing configuration with the configuration it downloads as part of the ZTP process.  
2. When the router receives a script (bash or python), it will execute the downloaded script which is responsible for applying a config to the router or perform any linux operation on the system.


## Understanding the Setup

Let us focus only on router `rtr2` for now. We intend to bootstrap it to a required configuration.


### DHCP setup

To respond to the router with the required file (script or config), the DHCP server must be suitably setup to identify the requesting router based on its Serial Number before responding with a bootfile-name (Option 67) specifying the file location.

The DHCP server expects the serial number to be provided by the IOS-XR router in Option 61 (client-identifier) as well as in option 124 (which contains the Serial Number, platform family and vendor code - 9 for Cisco). These are options for DHCPv4.

**You are NOT required to set up the DHCP server**. This is already done for you.
You will only modify some settings in the existing file as we go along.
Each router in the topology has a unique, persistent Serial-Number as well as a unique IP assigned to that Serial Number.

As the file below shows, the following IP addresses are assigned based on the Serial Numbers:

```
rtr1:  
    IPv4 Address:   100.96.0.14
    Serial Number:  FGE00080000
    
rtr2:
    IPv4 Address:   100.96.0.16
    Serial Number:  FGE000e0000
    
rtr3:
    IPv4 Address:   100.96.0.18
    Serial Number:  FGE00140000
    
rtr4:
    IPv4 Address:   100.96.0.26
    Serial Number:  FGE002c0000
```


To understand how, on the ZTP node, dump the `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` file:

```

tesuto@ztp:~$ 
tesuto@ztp:~$ cat /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 
# dhcpd.conf
#
# Sample configuration file for ISC dhcpd
#
# Attention: If /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf exists, that will be used as
# configuration file instead of this file.
#

# option definitions common to all supported networks...
option domain-name "cisco.local";

default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

# The ddns-updates-style parameter controls whether or not the server will
# attempt to do a DNS update when a lease is confirmed. We default to the
# behavior of the version 2 packages ('none', since DHCP v2 didn't
# have support for DDNS.)

### Focus on rtr2

The DHCP settings relevant to rtr2 are highlighted below:


<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
        class "xrv9k-rtr2" {
            match if (substring(option dhcp-client-identifier,0,11) = <mark>"FGE000e0000");</mark>
        }

        pool {
            allow members of "xrv9k-rtr2";
            <mark>range 100.96.0.16 100.96.0.16;</mark>
            next-server 100.96.0.20;

            log (info, option vendor-class.cisco-vendor-id-vendor-class);
            log (info, substring(option vendor-class.cisco-vendor-id-vendor-class,3,11));
            log (info, substring(option vendor-class.cisco-vendor-id-vendor-class,19,99));

            if exists user-class and option user-class = <mark>"exr-config" {</mark>
              if (substring(option vendor-class.cisco-vendor-id-vendor-class,3,11)=<mark>"FGE000e0000"</mark>)
              {
                if (substring(option vendor-class.cisco-vendor-id-vendor-class,19,99)="R-IOSXRV9000-CC")
                {
                    <mark>option bootfile-name "http://100.96.0.20/scripts/ztp_ncclient.py";</mark>
                    <mark>#option bootfile-name "http://100.96.0.20/configs/rtr2.config";</mark>
                }
              }
            }

            ddns-hostname "xrv9k-rtr2";
            option routers 100.96.0.1;
        }


</code>
</pre>
</div>



Notice that based on the Serial Number = `FGE000e0000`, rtr2 is assigned the IP address `100.96.0.16`.  

Further, when the user-class (option 77) in the router's DHCP request is `exr-config`, then bootfile-name is currently set to be:

```
option bootfile-name "http://100.96.0.20/scripts/ztp_ncclient.py"
```


This means that the script `ztp_ncclient.py` located on the web server at `http://100.96.0.20/scripts` will be specified to the router in option 67 causing the router `rtr2` to download and execute it.



### Understanding the current ZTP script


The current ZTP script for rtr2 can be found on the webserver running locally on the ZTP node at:

```
/var/www/html/scripts/ztp_ncclient.py.

```

Let's dump this script. The script has appropriate comments at different points to help a reader understand its content.   


```
tesuto@ztp:~$ 
tesuto@ztp:~$ cat /var/www/html/scripts/ztp_ncclient.py

Let's highlight the relevant portion for this exercise:

        nc_mgr.close_session()

        sys.exit(1)</mark>
</code>
</pre>
</div>

It shows 4 important steps:


1. Initialize the environment for ncclient:
   Using `ztp_script.ncclient_init(host_ip=host)`


2. Connect to the IOS-XR netconf server/agent with appropriate retries:

   ```
   # Connects to IOS-XR netconf agent and returns a manager handle for ncclient
    # This is a method of the child class defined above that retries the connection
    # during initial boot for a specified maximum duration (default = 120seconds)
    nc_mgr = ztp_script.ncclient_connect(host=host)
   ```


3. Once the ncclient manager is available (nc_mgr), peform all the typical operations as you would with ncclient (<https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient>). Close the ncclient session once you're done.

    ```
    # From here on, the operation is just normal ncclient usage
        response = nc_mgr.get_config(source="running")
        print(response)
        response_dict=xmltodict.parse(str(response))
        print json.dumps(response_dict, indent=4)
        nc_mgr.close_session()
        
    ```

4.  Finally, clean up the environment set up on the router during the ncclient_init() process:
    
    ```
    # Cleaning up the internal loopback configuration created as part of the
    # ncclient_init() configuration is good practice. This is optional however.
    result = ztp_script.ncclient_cleanup()
    if result["status"] == "error":
        ztp_script.syslogger.info("Failed to cleanup ncclient dependencies, aborting...")
        sys.exit(1)
    ```
    



You job is to focus only on the above highlighted portion of code to add ncclient operations such as `edit_config` using XML files from appropriate Yang models that the script will download during its operation.
